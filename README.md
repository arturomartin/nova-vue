# Vue support for Nova editor

This is a plugin providing Vue language support for the new [Nova editor from Panic](https://panic.com/nova/). Inspired by [Vetur](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur) and many other great Vue tools.

## Modes ðŸ”¥

The extension now support two different mode: **Classic** and **Vetur**! You can set it in the global extension preferences and also on a project based.

In the future I'll look into a way of combining the best of both worlds, in the meantime which one should you use? Of course is up to you ðŸ˜‰

### Classic (default)

Ad hoc completions for Nova and great snippets for faster development.

### Vetur

A complete Vetur like mode with all the great features you are already used to.
